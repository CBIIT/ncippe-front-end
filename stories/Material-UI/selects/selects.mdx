# Selects

<p className="description">Select components are used for collecting user provided information from a list of options.</p>

## Simple Select

Menus are positioned over their emitting elements such that the currently selected menu item appears on top of the emitting element.

## Native Select

As the user experience can be improved on mobile using the native select of the platform,
we allow such pattern.

<Example path="Material-UI/selects/examples/NativeSelects" />

## Customized selects

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

The first step is to style the `InputBase` component.
Once it's styled, you can either use it directly as a text field or provide it to the select `input` property to have a `select` field.

<Example path="Material-UI/selects/examples/CustomizedSelects" />

## Multiple Select

The `Select` component can handle multiple selections.
It's enabled with the `multiple` property.

Like with the single selection, you can pull out the new value by accessing `event.target.value` in the `onChange` callback. It's always an array.

## Controlled Open Select

## With a Dialog

While it's discouraged by the Material Design specification, you can use a select inside a dialog.

<Example path="Material-UI/selects/examples/DialogSelect" />

## Text Fields

The `TextField` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input and help text. You can find an example with the select mode [in this section](/components/text-fields/#textfield).
