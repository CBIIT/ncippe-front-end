# Buttons

<p className="description">Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.</p>

[Buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html) communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Dialogs
- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

## Contained Buttons

[Contained buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#contained-button)
are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill.
They contain actions that are primary to your app.

The last example of this demo show how to use an upload button.

## Text Buttons

[Text buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#text-button)
are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located:

- In dialogs
- In cards

In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.

## Outlined Buttons

[Outlined buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#outlined-button)
are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important,
but aren’t the primary action in an app.

### Alternatives

Outlined buttons are also a lower emphasis alternative to contained buttons,
or a higher emphasis alternative to text buttons.

<Example path="Material-UI/button/OutlinedButtons" />

## Grouped Buttons

The ButtonGroup component can be used to group outlined (the default) or contained buttons.

<Example path="Material-UI/button/GroupedButtons" />

## Split Button

ButtonGroup can also be used to create a split button. The dropdown can change the button action (as in this example), or be use to immediately trigger a related action.

<Example path="Material-UI/button/SplitButtons" />

## Floating Action Buttons

A [floating action button](https://material.io/design/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html)
(FAB) performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen.
It appears in front of all screen content, typically as a circular shape with an icon in its center.
FABs come in two types: regular, and extended.

Only use a FAB if it is the most suitable way to present a screen’s primary action.

Only one floating action button is recommended per screen to represent the most common action.

<Example path="Material-UI/button/FloatingActionButtons" />

The floating action button animates onto the screen as an expanding piece of material, by default.

## Sizes

Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Use the `size` property.

<Example path="Material-UI/button/ButtonSizes" />

## Buttons with icons and label

Sometimes you might want to have icons for certain button to enhance the UX of the application as we recognize logos more easily than plain text. For example, if you have a delete button you can label it with a dustbin icon.

<Example path="Material-UI/button/IconLabelButtons" />

## Icon Buttons

Icon buttons are commonly found in app bars and toolbars.

Icons are also appropriate for toggle buttons that allow a single choice to be selected or
deselected, such as adding or removing a star to an item.
