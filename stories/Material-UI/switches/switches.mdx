# Switches

<p className="description">Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off.</p>

[Switches](https://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html#switches) are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile.
The option that the switch controls, as well as the state itâ€™s in,
should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

## Switches with FormControlLabel

`Switch` can also be used with a label description thanks to the `FormControlLabel` component.

## Switches with FormGroup

`FormGroup` is a helpful wrapper used to group selection controls components that provides an easier API.
However, we encourage you to use a [Checkbox](#checkboxes) instead.

## Customized switches

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

## Label placement

You can change the placement of the label:

## Accessibility

All form controls should have labels, and this includes radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches. In most cases, this is done by using the `<label>` element ([FormControlLabel](/api/form-control-label/)).

When a label can't be used, it's necessary to add an attribute directly to the input component.
In this case, you can apply the additional attribute (e.g. `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`) via the `inputProps` property.

```jsx
<Switch
  value="checkedA"
  inputProps={{ 'aria-label': 'Switch A' } }
/>
```
