# Included Packages

Below is the listing of all npm packages installed by the site and a brief description of their purpose.

| Package | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
|[@material-ui/core](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) | React components based on [Material Design](https://material.io/design). This package is used as the foundation for most of our custom components. This package includes [@material-ui/styles/](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/next/packages/material-ui-styles), which is a `CSS-in-JS` solution that implements [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.5.0). With `@material-ui/styles/` we were able to developed a custom visual theme for this project. See [Styling](/?path=/docs/architecture-styling--page) for more details.  |
|[@material-ui/icons](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/next/packages/material-ui-icons) | This package provides the Google [Material icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/) packaged as a set of React components. This is used for some of our iconogrophy, but most of our icons were custom made and reside in the `/public/assets/icons` folder |
|[@material-ui/lab](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/next/packages/material-ui-lab) | This package hosts the incubator components that are not yet ready to move to `@material-ui/core`. We are using only the [Toggle Button](https://material-ui.com/components/toggle-button/) component from this package. |
|[@reach/router](https://reach.tech/router/) | Reach Router is a small, simple router for React that has a small footprint, supports only simple route patterns by design, and has strong accessibility features. This is used to switch between "pages" in our Single Page App (SPA). This router was selected over [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) because it was easier to integrate with our OIDC client for user authentication. However, we later switched to NIH's Site Minder SSO for user authentication.  |

This is needed to mimic new JavaScript features in older web browsers. |
